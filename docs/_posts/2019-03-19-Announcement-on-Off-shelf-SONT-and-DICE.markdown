Recently, a number of user feedback ont.bet website can not be opened, and the ont bet team can not contact. After verification by ontdex-team, the situation is confirmed.

In view of this, ontde-team believes that SONT and DICE have lost their original value, and will deal with their Off-Shelf transactions. The Off-Shelf time is Singapore time, 29 March 2019, 8 p.m. .

Because ontdex is a de-centralized exchange, once deleted, the transaction pair will not be recovered. When the transaction pair is deleted, the SONT and DICE that still exist in sell order will be transferred to ontdex's service fee income address, and the ONG that buys will continue to exist in the ontdex smart contract and cannot be retrieved. If the user wants to recover the Off-Shelf assets, he can only apply to ontdex for asset recovery by email, and the recovery process will be long. Therefore, the majority of users are requested to cancel the pending order of SONT/ONG and DICE/ONG transaction pairs before the off-shelf time.
